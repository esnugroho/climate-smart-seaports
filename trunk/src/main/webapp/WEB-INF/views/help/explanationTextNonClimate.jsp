<h6>Non-Climate Context</h6>

<p class="justified">Non-climate data helps set the operational context of ports. It also provides a starting point for consideration of possible impacts of non-climate factors into the future. For example, population growth along the coast can constrain a port's ability to expand in the future, and to retreat as sea level rise and climatic conditions change. National population growth can also be a driver of increased activity at container import ports, which may lead to congestion problems. 

<p class="justified">This tab identifies particular non-climate-related information.  It includes trade and population data. Note that only limited data may be available for some ports. 

<p class="justified">Two publicly available data sets are offered within this section. These are urban pressure data derived from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and freight data from Ports Australia and individual ports' published annual reports.

<p class="justified">Recognising that non-climate information will be gathered by ports themselves, this section allows for ports to upload port-specific files and information regarding organisational objectives, current risks, or data on throughput volume or the types of activity that characterise the port. 

<p class="justified">Users can select from three main data sources on this tab:</p>

<p class="justified"><strong>"ABS"</strong> data, which provides Population change data;</p>

<p class="justified"><strong>"Ports Australia data"</strong> which provides data on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Freight throughput by cargo type,</li>
		<li>Commercial vessel calls by type, and</li> 
		<li>Export commodities by type</li>
	</ul>
<p class="justified"><strong>"Custom file"</strong> data which can be text and/or images provided by the port, relating to their current, non-climate context.</p>
