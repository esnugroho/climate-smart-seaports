<h6>Observed Climate</h6>

<p class=&quot;justified&quot;>This tab sets the historical and current context of climate and marine observations for ports, to assist ports understand their current climate context. It includes data publicly available from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO.</p>
Three types of data have been selected: 
<ul>
	<li>national trends for temperature and rainfall;</li>
	<li>global and national trends for sea-level rise; and</li>
	<li>specific weather station data (including examples of extreme weather events).</li>
</ul>

<p>Users select from two main data sources in this tab:</p>
<strong>&quot;CSIRO and BoM trend data&quot;</strong> which provides national or global data on: 
<ul>
	<li>Trend in mean temperatures,</li>
	<li>Trend in maximum temperatures,</li>
	<li>Trend in total annual rainfall,</li>
	<li>Long-term sea level rise measurements and</li> 
	<li>Shorter term changes in sea level.</li>
</ul>
<strong>&quot;ACORN-SAT&quot;</strong> which provides data from specific weather stations for:
<ul>
	<li>Mean measurements (annual mean surface temperature, annual mean rainfall, annual mean relative humidity and annual mean wind speed)</li>
	<li>Extreme measurements (highest temperature, highest daily rainfall, maximum wind gust)</li>
</ul>
