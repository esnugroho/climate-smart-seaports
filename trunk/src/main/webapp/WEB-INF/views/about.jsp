		<h2>About Climate Smart Seaports</h2>
	</center>
	<br />
	<p class="info-paragraph">This project extends existing applied research activity funded by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) "Enhancing the resilience of seaports to a changing climate", and adds value through the development of an online decision support tool which will enable Australian port authorities to make better informed climate risk management decisions.  Data for the tool was sourced from public entities: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Ports Australia.</p> 

	<p class="info-paragraph">The Climate Smart Seaports Tool was created by RMIT University eResearch in partnership with the Climate Change Adaptation Program, with funding provided by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS).  ANDS aims to lead the creation of a cohesive national collection of research resources that makes better use of Australian research outputs, enables Australian researchers to easily publish, discover, access and use data, and enables new and more efficient research.</p>

	<p class="info-paragraph">RMIT would particularly like to thank Gippsland Ports and Sydney Ports Corporation for their support in the development of the Climate Smart Seaports Tool.</p>  

	<p class="info-paragraph">All data in this tool has been sourced from third parties (which is indicated throughout the tool).</p> 
	<br />
