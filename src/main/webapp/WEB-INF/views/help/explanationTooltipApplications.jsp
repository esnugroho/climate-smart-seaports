<h6>Applications</h6>

<strong>Concrete Deterioration Model</strong>

<p class=&quot;justified&quot;>This tab connects users to an engineering tool that models rates of concrete deterioration under conditions of climate change in a port environment.</p>

It provides:
<ol>
	<li>a set of example outputs for those who are not engineers, and</li> 
	<li>the tool for the engineers that have the knowledge to use it</li>
</ol>

The tool enables the user to define:
<ul>
	<li>The concrete: e.g.: distance from coast, zone of activity (atmosphere, tidal, splash, submerged), size of structure,  depth of cover, diameter of rebar, water-to-cement ratio, cement content, depth of carbonation from maintenance records etc.;</li>
	<li>The potential climate influences (following the range provided in the Future Climate tab), and;</li>
	<li>A date range for all years 2013 - 2070</li>
</ul>

<p class=&quot;justified&quot;>Data is not currently available for port areas in the South South West Flatlands West (SSWFW) Region.</p>				

<strong>Vulnerability Assessment</strong>

<p class=&quot;justified&quot;>This tab allows users to identify the current vulnerability of a nominated port to particular climate related events. It presents a series of questions, exploring how recent climate-related events have disrupted operations at the port, and what this has meant for the port's business.</p> 

<p class=&quot;justified&quot;>When considering the questions in this tab, think of the impact on port assets (machinery, buildings, equipment), infrastructure (drainage, rail, road, berths), and people (injuries, work disruptions).</p>
