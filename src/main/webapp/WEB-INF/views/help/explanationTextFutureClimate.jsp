<h6>Future Climate</h6>

<p class="justified">The future climate context faced by ports is an important factor in future planning and risk assessment processes. Direct impacts on ports, and indirect impacts on supply chains, will impact capital investment, maintenance requirements, as well as knowledge, skill and training requirements for personnel. Understanding potential future climate impacts allows ports to adequately assess their future planning options, and accommodate the most appropriate adaptation choices. 
				
<p class="justified">This tab assists ports to identify some of the future climate projections data relevant for their region.   

<p class="justified">Global climate models were selected using CSIRO's Climate Futures tool. Projections were classified using two climate variables: rainfall and temperature, and grouped into "climate futures", for example "hotter &amp; drier" or "cooler and wetter". Likelihoods were then assigned according to the number of climate models that fell within each category. In this application, three global climate models from the following categories are offered for users to choose from: "hotter &amp; drier", "cooler &amp; wetter" and "most likely"</p>

<p class="justified">Users select from two data sources (CSIRO and CMAR), and then select from a choice of variables.</p>
<strong>"CSIRO"</strong> which displays future climate projection data for:
<ul>
	<li>Temperature, rainfall wind speed and relative humidity</li>
	<li>Two emissions scenarios: A1B (medium) and A1FI (high)</li>
	<li>Three climate models: most likely, hotter &amp; drier, and cooler &amp; wetter</li>
	<li>Three time periods: 2030, 2055 and 2070</li>
</ul>

<p class="justified"><strong>"CMAR"</strong> which only displays sea-level rise data for the "medium emissions scenario (A1B)", using a "most likely" climate model, for two time periods, "2030" and "2070".</p>
