<h6>Applications</h6>

<strong>Concrete Deterioration Model</strong>

<p class="justified">Climate change will affect the rate of deterioration of materials such as concrete, timber and steel. The main construction material at ports is concrete and the rate of its deterioration will affect maintenance schedules, budgets and long term plans for refurbishment and replacement.</p>

<p class="justified">This tab provides access to a tool designed by engineers that models rates of concrete deterioration under conditions of climate change in a port environment.</p>

It provides:
<ol>
	<li>a set of example outputs for those who are not engineers, and</li> 
	<li>the tool for the engineers that have the knowledge to use it</li>
</ol>

The tool enables the user to define:
<ul>
	<li>The concrete: e.g.: distance from coast, zone of activity (atmosphere, tidal, splash, submerged), size of structure,  depth of cover, diameter of rebar, water-to-cement ratio, cement content, depth of carbonation from maintenance records etc.;</li>
	<li>The potential climate influences (following the range provided in the Future Climate tab), and;</li>
	<li>A date range for all years 2013 - 2070</li>
</ul>

<p class="justified">Data is not currently available for port areas in the South South West Flatlands West (SSWFW) Region.</p>				

<strong>Vulnerability Assessment</strong>

<p class="justified">When considering impacts of climate change, the term vulnerability represents exposure to a particular climate variable combined with the level of sensitivity to that variable, or the degree of impact.</p>

<p class="justified">The Climate Smart Seaports Tool assists users to investigate vulnerability to current extreme climate-related events. How a port copes with, and responds to current extreme weather events, can be an indication of how well it will cope with future climate change.</p>

<p class="justified">This tab allows users to identify the current vulnerability of a nominated port to particular climate related events. It presents a series of questions, exploring how recent climate-related events have disrupted operations at the port, and what this has meant for the port's business.</p> 

<p class="justified">When considering the questions in this tab, think of the impact on port assets (machinery, buildings, equipment), infrastructure (drainage, rail, road, berths), and people (injuries, work disruptions).</p>
